                This tutorial shows you step-by-step how to monitor your Jetty server using Java-monitor. Java-monitor is a third-party web application which monitors your server status, and allows you to access this information from a central location.

              <p>To get up and running with Java-monitor requires a few steps:</p>

                <span class="mw-headline" id="Check_Your_Java_Version">Check Your Java Version</span>
              </h3>
              <p>Java-monitor only works if you run Jetty on Java 5 or newer.</p>
              <p>Java 5 introduced a very useful set of JMX MBeans for monitoring the JVM. Java-monitor builds on these. JMX was available in older version of Java, but unfortunately the useful MBeans are not available. For this reason, Java-monitor does not support older JVM's. We cannot monitor garbage collector activity in older Java VM's.</p>
              <h3>

              </h3>
              <p>
                Java-monitor relies on JMX to gather statistics from your Jetty instance. See
                <a href="../Howto/Run Jetty with JConsole.html" title="Jetty/Howto/Run Jetty with JConsole">How to Run Jetty with JConsole</a>
                for instructions on how to turn on JMX when starting your server instance.

              <p>Java-monitor is an on-line monitoring service. The statistics are collected centrally, by Java-monitor's servers. You will need the account to log into Java-monitor and see your gathered data.</p>
              <p>Please take a moment to consider what e-mail address you will be registering with. The e-mail that you used for registering the account will receive the notification e-mails in case a server goes off-line.</p>
              <p>Please note that if your employer imposes strict data retention regulations, you may be barred from using Java-monitor. Most large multinationals do not allow production servers to send even relatively uninteresting data, such as memory statistics, out onto the Internet.</p>
              <p>This centralised approach may seem a little awkward at first, but you'll see why we work like that when you are out of the road and you have to explain a server outage. Java-monitor allows you to access the statistics from your iPhone or Android phone, even when your Jetty server has gone off-line. Restarting no longer erases all evidence of the problem, and you can still see the graphs from before the restart.</p>
              <p>Don't worry about who can and cannot see your data. You are the only one who can see the data from your hosts. Each Java-monitor user only sees his or her own hosts.</p>

                Once you are registered and logged in, download your personalised probe.
                <a class="external free" href="http://java-monitor.com/lemongrass/java-monitor-probe.zip" rel="nofollow">http://java-monitor.com/lemongrass/java-monitor-probe.zip</a>
              </p>
              <p>This probe is generated for each account individually, so don't share it with your co-workers. :-)</p>
              <h3>
                <span class="mw-headline" id="Unzip_the_Probe">Unzip the Probe</span>
              </h3>
              <p>Unzip the downloaded ZIP file with your favourite unzipper. Inside, you will find a file named java-monitor.war. This file is the actual probe. As you can see, Java-monitor's probe is pretty small, just under 100k.</p>
              <h3>
                <span class="mw-headline" id="Install_the_Probe">Install the Probe</span>
              </h3>
              <p>Deploy the probe in your Jetty server. It is just a regular WAR file. You can deploy it just like you are used to.</p>
              <h3>

              </h3>
              <p>Once the probe is deployed, check your Jetty logs for error messages. If there are none, go to the Java-monitor forum home page to see the gathered statistics and the latest discussion.</p>
              <h3>
                <span class="mw-headline" id="Done">Done</span>
              </h3>
              <p>That's it. You will automatically receive e-mail notifications for hosts that go off-line.</p>
              <p>If you like, you can also enable SMS notifications for your production machines.</p>
              <p>In case there is a problem that you would like us to explain just ask on the forum. You'll find a link under each graph to make it easy to post that graph in a forum. Go ahead and try it. We have a /dev/null forum just for that purpose.</p>
              <p>We look forward to meeting you on the forum. :-)</p>
